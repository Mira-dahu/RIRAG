Authorised Persons should establish and maintain procedures for judging the necessity of and calculating an adjustment to the current valuation of less liquid positions for regulatory capital purposes. This adjustment may be in addition to any changes to the value of the position required for financial reporting purposes and should be designed to reflect the illiquidity of the position. The Regulator expects Authorised Persons to consider the need for an adjustment to a position's valuation to reflect current illiquidity whether the position is marked to market using market prices or observable inputs, third party valuations or marked to model."

Bearing in mind that the assumptions made in relation to calculating VaR may not be consistent with the Authorised Person's ability to sell or hedge out less liquid positions, where appropriate, Authorised Persons should take an adjustment to the current valuation of these positions, and review their continued appropriateness on an on going basis. Reduced liquidity may have arisen from market events. Additionally, close out prices for concentrated positions and/or stale positions should be considered in establishing the adjustment."

    "answer": "The expectations for documenting the rationale and methodology behind valuation adjustments for less liquid positions are detailed and rigorous. Authorised Persons are required to establish and maintain procedures for judging the necessity of and calculating adjustments to the current valuation of less liquid positions for regulatory capital purposes. These adjustments should reflect the illiquidity of the positions and may exceed those made under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and other guidance notes.\n\n### Key Expectations:\n\n1. **Establishment and Maintenance of Procedures**:\n   - Authorised Persons must create and uphold procedures for determining and calculating adjustments to the valuation of less liquid positions (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: APP2.A2.5.Guidance.10).\n\n2. **Consideration of Illiquidity**:\n   - The adjustment should be designed to reflect the illiquidity of the position, whether the position is marked to market using market prices, observable inputs, third-party valuations, or marked to model (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: APP2.A2.5.Guidance.10).\n\n3. **Relevant Factors for Adjustment**:\n   - Authorised Persons should consider various factors when determining the appropriateness of the adjustment, including time to hedge, volatility of bid/offer spreads, availability of market quotes, trading volumes, market concentrations, aging of positions, reliance on marking to model, and other model risks (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: APP2.A2.5.Guidance.12).\n\n4. **Ongoing Review**:\n   - Adjustments should be reviewed continuously for their continued appropriateness, especially in light of market events that may reduce liquidity (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: APP2.A2.5.Guidance.11).\n\n5. **Model Risk Assessment**:\n   - For complex products, Authorised Persons should explicitly assess the need for valuation adjustments to reflect model risk, including the risk associated with using an incorrect valuation methodology and unobservable calibration parameters (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: APP2.A2.5.Guidance.13).\n\n6. **Formal Consideration of Valuation Adjustments**:\n   - The Regulator expects formal consideration of various valuation adjustments, such as unearned credit spreads, close-out costs, operational risks, early termination, investing and funding costs, future administrative costs, and model risk (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: APP2.A2.5.Guidance.9).\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The Regulator will assess an Authorised Person's valuation procedures for consistency with the provided guidance and may impose a valuation adjustment if there is a material inconsistency (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: 2.4.Guidance.4.).\n- Recognised Clearing Houses must also record the results of stress testing and the rationale for any adjustments made to their liquid resources (DocumentID: 10, PassageID: 4.7.34).\n\n### Conclusion:\nAuthorised Persons are expected to document their rationale and methodology for valuation adjustments of less liquid positions comprehensively, ensuring that all relevant factors and risks are considered. This documentation should be maintained and reviewed regularly to ensure its continued appropriateness and consistency with regulatory guidance."
