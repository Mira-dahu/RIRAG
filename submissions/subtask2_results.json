    "answer": "The expectations for documenting the rationale and methodology behind valuation adjustments for less liquid positions are detailed across several references. Below is a summary of the key requirements based on the provided legal documents:\n\n1. **Comprehensive Documentation of Policies and Procedures**:\n   - Authorised Persons are required to maintain **documented policies and procedures** for the valuation process. This includes specifying the rationale and methodology used for valuation adjustments. Such policies must cover:\n     - Clearly defined responsibilities for the determination of valuations across different areas.\n     - Sources of market information and a review of their appropriateness.\n     - Guidelines for using unobservable inputs, which reflect assumptions that market participants would use to price less liquid positions.\n     - Procedures for adjusting valuations, including at month-end and for ad hoc verifications (References 1(a) and 2(a)).\n\n2. **Integration with Risk Management and Independent Reporting Lines**:\n   - The valuation process must be integrated with risk management systems (e.g., credit analysis) to ensure reliability and prudence (Reference 1).\n   - The department responsible for valuations must have **clear and independent reporting lines**, free from the influence of the front office, and report to a senior executive (References 1(b) and 2(b)).\n\n3. **Valuation Adjustments**:\n   - The Regulator expects certain specific valuation adjustments to be considered formally. These include adjustments for **unearned credit spreads, close-out costs, operational risks, early termination, investing and funding costs, future administrative costs**, and, where relevant, **model risk** (Reference 5).\n   - These adjustments should be clearly documented, with the rationale for each adjustment explicitly stated.\n\n4. **Sensitivity Analysis and Key Assumptions**:\n   - The documentation should include an analysis of how sensitive the valuation is to changes in key assumptions (e.g., commodity prices, discount rates, and inflation). This is particularly important for less liquid positions where reliance on assumptions is greater (Reference 4(3)).\n   - A risk factor analysis should also highlight uncertainties in assumptions and their potential effect on valuation outcomes (Reference 4(5)).\n\n5. **Adherence to Prudent Valuation Practices**:\n   - Authorised Persons are expected to follow prudent valuation practices, ensuring that valuations for less liquid positions remain reliable even in the absence of active market prices (Reference 3). \n\n### Summary\nTo meet regulatory expectations, Authorised Persons must establish and maintain robust systems and controls to document the rationale and methodology for valuation adjustments of less liquid positions. This includes maintaining detailed policies, incorporating risk management, performing sensitivity analysis, and addressing specific valuation adjustments such as model risk and operational risks. The process must be independent of the front office and ensure full transparency to both senior management and the Regulator. \n\nRelevant Citations: References 1(a)-(b), 2(a)-(b), 4(3)-(5), and 5."

    "answer": "To demonstrate to the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) that an Authorised Person or Recognised Body is in full compliance with its obligations toward the Shari’a Supervisory Board (SSB) as per AAOIFI GSIFI No. (2), the following documentation and evidence are required based on the provided legal references:\n\n### 1. **Documentation of Compliance with Shari’a Supervisory Board Obligations**\n   - **Competency Assessment Records:**  \n     The Authorised Person or Recognised Body must maintain records of its assessment of the competency of the SSB members, as required under **IFR 3.5.3(a)**. This ensures that the appointed members have the requisite expertise to oversee compliance with Shari’a principles.\n   - **Terms of Engagement:**  \n     The agreed terms of engagement for each SSB member must be recorded and maintained as per **IFR 3.5.3(b)**. These terms should outline the roles, responsibilities, and scope of duties of the SSB members.\n   - **Other Relevant Matters:**  \n     Records must include details required under **IFR 3.5.2(c)** and **IFR 3.5.3**, which would encompass:\n     - The criteria for the appointment of the SSB.\n     - Documentation of Shari’a compliance reviews conducted.\n\n### 2. **Disclosure to Clients**\n   - An Authorised Person or Recognised Body must provide:\n     - **Details of SSB Members:** At the outset of the client relationship and upon request, details of the members of the SSB must be disclosed, as stipulated in **IFR 3.8.1(b)(i)**.\n     - **Shari’a Review Procedures:** The manner and frequency of Shari’a reviews must also be disclosed upon request, in line with **IFR 3.8.1(b)(ii)**.\n\n### 3. **Maintenance of Records**\n   - As per **IFR 3.5.3**, all required records, including the competency assessments, terms of engagement, and compliance documentation, must be maintained for a period of **six years**. This ensures that ADGM has access to historical records for review if necessary.\n\n### 4. **Specific Considerations for Funds**\n   - **If the Fund Manager Appoints the Firm's SSB to the Fund:**  \n     If a Fund Manager chooses to appoint the same SSB to the Fund as it has at the firm level (under **IFR 6.2.1(b)**), the documents and records required under **IFR 3.5.3** must also be included in or form part of the Fund’s records.\n   - **For Exempt or Qualified Investor Funds:**  \n     While these funds are not required to have a separate SSB, the Fund Manager must ensure ongoing compliance with Shari’a requirements (References 2 and 3). Evidence of such compliance may involve using members of the firm’s SSB and demonstrating compliance to the Unitholders as per the negotiated terms of their agreement.\n\n### 5. **Manner of Demonstration to ADGM**\n   - The Authorised Person or Recognised Body must be prepared to provide the records outlined above as evidence of compliance. These records collectively demonstrate that:\n     - The SSB is composed of competent individuals.\n     - Proper engagement terms and ongoing reviews are in place.\n     - Shari’a compliance is actively monitored and documented.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, to demonstrate compliance with obligations toward the Shari’a Supervisory Board, an Authorised Person or Recognised Body must maintain and disclose records related to the competency, engagement, and compliance reviews of the SSB members as per **IFR 3.5.3** and **IFR 3.8.1**. For Fund Managers, additional records may be necessary depending on the type of fund and whether the firm-level SSB is used. All such records must be preserved for six years to ensure compliance with ADGM’s regulatory framework."

    "answer": "When applying for a Financial Services Permission (FSP) in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), applicants often encounter deficiencies or oversights that may delay or complicate the application process. To ensure a smooth and efficient application, it is crucial to be aware of the following common issues and address them adequately. The analysis below is supported by relevant provisions from the provided legal documents:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Inadequate Systems and Controls (Reference 1)**\nApplicants frequently fail to demonstrate that they have adequate systems and controls to meet regulatory requirements, particularly when intending to carry on regulated activities with or for **Retail Clients**. The applicant must ensure:\n   - Systems and controls are in place to handle retail client activities effectively (Reference 1(1)).\n   - Policies and procedures are established to comply with **Conduct of Business Rules (COBS)** relevant to retail clients (Reference 1(2)).\n   - Systems and controls ensure that employees are **competent and capable** of performing their assigned roles, particularly those involving retail clients (Reference 1(3)).\n   - Robust complaints handling policies and procedures are in place (Reference 1(4)).\n\nFailure to meet these requirements can result in regulatory concerns, so applicants should perform thorough assessments of their internal controls and compliance frameworks.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Insufficient or Incomplete Application Details (Reference 5)**\nApplications for FSPs must include:\n   - A clear **statement of the specific regulated activities** the applicant intends to undertake (Reference 5(a)).\n   - The address of a place within the ADGM where notices or documents can be served on the applicant (Reference 5(b)).\n\nIncomplete or unclear information in these areas may lead to delays or rejections. Applicants should ensure that all required information is accurate and aligns with their business objectives.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Oversights in Preparing for Ongoing Obligations (Reference 3)**\nOnce an applicant is granted a Financial Services Permission, they must continue to comply with the regulatory requirements outlined in the applicable provisions **on an ongoing basis** (Reference 3(3)). Applicants sometimes underestimate the operational and compliance infrastructure necessary to maintain compliance post-approval. This includes:\n   - Adequate resourcing to meet reporting, monitoring, and risk management obligations.\n   - Continued employee training and compliance awareness.\n\nApplicants should therefore plan for their long-term obligations from the outset.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Mismanagement of Regulatory Amendments (Reference 4)**\nApplicants applying to amend an existing Financial Services Permission—whether to serve retail clients, add regulated activities, or conduct Islamic Financial Business—often fail to account for the associated **application fees**:\n   - A $5,000 fee applies to amendments such as enabling services for retail clients or conducting Islamic Financial Business (Reference 4(b), (c)).\n   - Other amendments or removal of conditions also incur a $5,000 fee (Reference 4(d)).\n\nUnderstanding the financial and procedural implications of amending permissions helps avoid unnecessary delays or rejected requests.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Neglecting Customer Arrangements for Withdrawal of Permissions (Reference 2)**\nIf an applicant later seeks to withdraw their Financial Services Permission, they may face regulatory hurdles if customer arrangements are not properly managed. Common deficiencies include:\n   - Failing to return customer deposits or assets (Reference 2(b), (c)).\n   - Not resolving pending matters such as obtaining customer consent or transferring business operations (Reference 2(a), (d)).\n\nApplicants should proactively establish procedures for potential withdrawal scenarios, particularly for client asset management, to avoid regulatory complications.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Applicants**\nTo avoid these deficiencies, applicants should:\n1. **Conduct Pre-Application Reviews**: Ensure internal systems, controls, and policies comply with ADGM requirements, particularly for retail client services.\n2. **Provide Accurate and Complete Information**: Verify that all application details, including addresses and proposed activities, are fully detailed and precise.\n3. **Plan for Ongoing Compliance**: Develop robust systems to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements on an ongoing basis.\n4. **Understand Financial Implications**: Be prepared to meet the required application fees for amendments or other changes to permissions.\n5. **Prepare Exit Strategies**: Establish processes for managing customer obligations in the event of a withdrawal of permissions.\n\nBy addressing these areas proactively, applicants can minimize delays and improve their chances of a smooth and successful application process."

    "answer": "The Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) provides a framework for Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) to potentially operate both a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) and an RIE under the same Recognition Order. Such permission may be granted in specific scenarios where operational and regulatory requirements are met. Below are examples and relevant considerations based on the provided legal documents:\n\n### 1. **Scenarios Where a RIE May Operate Both an MTF and RIE**\n   - **Operation of Markets in Financial Instruments and Digital Securities**:  \n     A RIE can operate primary and secondary markets for Financial Instruments, including Digital Securities, under its Recognition Order. If an MTF using Virtual Assets (e.g., trading platforms facilitating virtual asset transactions) wishes to expand into Digital Securities, it may seek to meet the requirements to be recognised as a Digital Securities RIE. However, additional conditions would apply (Reference 2, Reference 4).\n   - **Spot Commodity Activities**:  \n     A RIE may also operate an MTF or Organised Trading Facility (OTF) dealing in Accepted Spot Commodities under its Recognition Order, subject to compliance with MIR Rule 3.4.2. This provides flexibility for RIEs to engage in trading activities beyond Financial Instruments, provided the appropriate permissions are obtained from the FSRA (Reference 5).\n\n### 2. **Additional Requirements for Operating Both an MTF and RIE**\nTo operate both an MTF and an RIE under a single Recognition Order, the entity must meet the following additional requirements:\n\n   - **Recognition Requirements**:  \n     The RIE must demonstrate compliance with the Recognition Requirements outlined in **Chapters 2 and 3 of the Market Infrastructure Rules (MIR)**. This includes rules related to governance, systems, market conduct, and operational resilience. Compliance must be maintained on an ongoing basis after the Recognition Order is granted (Reference 2).\n\n   - **Direct Client Access Restrictions**:  \n     While the FSRA has allowed Virtual Asset MTFs to operate on a direct client access basis since May 2019, this relief does not automatically extend to RIEs handling Digital Securities. For RIEs wishing to operate with direct client access, they must engage early with the FSRA to address specific operational and policy concerns (Reference 1).\n\n   - **Admission and Listing of Digital Securities**:  \n     If the RIE plans to admit Digital Securities for trading, these securities must be included in the Official List of Securities maintained by the FSRA and offered via an Approved Prospectus. The Issuer or Reporting Entity must comply with the Listing Rules outlined in Chapter 2 of the Market Rules (MKT) (Reference 4).\n\n   - **Virtual Asset Custody and Fiat Token Use**:  \n     If the RIE or its MTF uses Virtual Assets (e.g., fiat tokens issued by third parties), it must meet the FSRA’s **Accepted Virtual Assets, Technology Governance, and AML/CFT requirements**. Due diligence on third-party issuers and compliance with technology governance is essential (Reference 3).\n\n### 3. **Practical Implications**\n   - The FSRA’s flexibility in allowing a single entity to operate both an RIE and an MTF is dependent on the entity’s ability to manage the distinct operational and regulatory requirements of each platform.\n   - Entities should proactively engage with the FSRA to clarify expectations, particularly for complex activities such as combining direct client access with Digital Securities trading or using fiat tokens for transactions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the FSRA permits RIEs to operate MTFs or OTFs under the same Recognition Order, the entity must meet stringent requirements to ensure compliance and market integrity. Entities seeking such permissions should demonstrate their ability to fulfill all relevant Recognition Requirements under the MIR and address any additional considerations based on the type of trading activities they intend to conduct."

        "Passage": "REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nWhen considering the FATF Recommendations, in combination with the application of the AML Rules, the FSRA notes the following key principles that an Authorised Person conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets should consider:\n\na)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\nFATF expects countries, regulators, financial institutions and other concerned parties to adopt a ‘Risk Based Approach’ (“RBA”). Authorised Persons are expected to understand the risks associated with their activities and allocate proper resources to mitigate those risks. A RBA can only be achieved if it is embedded into the compliance culture of the Authorised Person, which enables the Authorised Person to make decisions and allocate appropriate resources in the most efficient and effective way.\n\nb)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\nAuthorised Persons should, on a periodic basis, carry out a proper risk based assessment of their processes and activities. In order to implement the RBA, Authorised Persons are expected to have processes in place to identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate ML risks. The general principle is that in circumstances where there are higher risks of ML, Authorised Persons are required to implement enhanced measures to manage and mitigate those risks.\n\nc)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\nOne of the most challenging risks facing financial institutions is how the on-boarding of an Authorised Person may affect its relationship with foreign correspondent financial institutions, as well as the views of the regulator of those foreign correspondent financial institutions. In essence, a foreign correspondent financial institution relationship is built on the effectiveness of a financial institution’s ML compliance program and ongoing monitoring capabilities.\n\nd)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\nWith the use of cryptology and block chain technologies at a nascent stage within financial services, any financial institution banking an Authorised Person must not only satisfy itself, but also its foreign correspondent financial institution(s), that the Authorised Person is well regulated and has appropriate systems and controls in place to address ML, TF and sanctions risks.  These systems and controls should include robust processes to carry out CDD on Clients and beneficial owners, to monitor transactions for these risks, and the willingness and ability of the Authorised Person to provide complete transparency to its financial institution(s) and foreign correspondent financial institution(s) if and when required.\n\n\ne)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 2: Business Risk Assessment\nChapter 6 of the AML Rules requires Relevant Persons to take appropriate steps to identify and assess the ML risks to which their businesses are exposed, taking into consideration the nature, size and complexity of their activities. When identifying and assessing these risks, several factors should be considered, including an assessment of the use of new technologies.  Importantly, in the context of Virtual Assets, FATF Recommendation (15) states that:\n\n“Countries and financial institutions should identify and assess the money laundering or terrorist financing risks that may arise in relation to (a) the development of new products and new business practices, including new delivery mechanisms, and (b) the use of new or developing technologies for both new and pre-existing products. In the case of financial institutions, such a risk assessment should take place prior to the launch of the new products, business practices or the use of new or developing technologies. They should take appropriate measures to manage and mitigate those risks.”\n\nf)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 2: Business Risk Assessment\nAnother aspect of assessing the business risk relevant to Authorised Persons is gaining familiarity with the characteristics and terminology  of the Virtual Asset industry. Additionally, Authorised Persons, and their management and staff, should be aware of the possible misuse of Virtual Assets in criminal activities, as well as the technical and complicated nature of Virtual Assets (and the platforms they operate on).\n\ng)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 2: Business Risk Assessment\nWhen making its assessment, an Authorised Person must give consideration to all business risks. For example, while an issue may be identified in relation to cyber security (e.g., when dealing with hot wallets or using cloud computing to store data – being a ‘technology’ risk), the FSRA expects Authorised Persons to consider these risks from all perspectives to establish whether the risk triggers other issues for consideration (including ML/TF risks, technology governance and consumer protection).  An Authorised Person must then use the identified risks to develop and maintain its AML/CTF policies, procedures, systems and controls and take all reasonable steps to eliminate or manage such risks.\n\n\nh)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nThe FSRA expects all Authorised Persons to have fully compliant Client on-boarding processes.  Virtual Assets have been criticised by regulatory bodies globally due to their (pseudo-)anonymity features, which makes tracking Client records and transactions more challenging for compliance officers and money laundering reporting officers.\n\ni)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nCustomer Risk Assessment and ‘Customer Due Diligence’ (“CDD”) policies and procedures are required to be implemented by all Authorised Persons. Authorised Persons should have a process to assess and rate all their Clients according to that Client’s risk profile (and taking into consideration the Authorised Persons’ RBA). This risk-based assessment is required to be undertaken for each Client prior to transacting any business on behalf of the Client. Authorised Persons must undertake CDD for each Client and comply in full with Chapter 8 of the AML Rules noting that the FSRA does not consider it appropriate for Authorised Persons to use simplified CDD when conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets, largely due to issues surrounding the (pseudo-) anonymity of Clients and transactions associated with Virtual Assets.\n\nj)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nIn the case of non-face-to-face on-boarding and ongoing due diligence of Clients who are natural persons, the FSRA expects that an Authorised Person will develop appropriate policies to ensure that the Client’s identity is duly verified in accordance with all applicable Laws and Rules. This may include obtaining a “selfie” or by conducting a “liveness test”. Irrespective of the method employed, it should validate that the individual being on-boarded is present during the on-boarding process, matches the individual in the identity documentation, and that the ID presented is valid and authentic. It should also include obtaining and authenticating a valid form of the Client’s facial ID, which should be either the Client’s passport with all applicable details clear and, or the original version (front and back) of an official government issued document, such as a national ID or driver’s license. For the purposes of residents of the UAE, the primary form of documentation used should be the Client’s Emirates ID card.\n\nk)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nThe FSRA understands that Authorised Persons may need to use new technology to improve Client on-boarding processes for the purpose of assessing and managing ML and TF risks.  For example, in order for Authorised Persons to conduct non-face-to-face on-boarding they will need to implement facial recognition software to validate the “selfie” against the other uploaded documentation, or other suitable biometric technology.\n\nl)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nThe FSRA further understands that the proper use of such technologies (e.g., fingerprinting, retinal/eye scans, use of real-time video conference facilities to enable facial recognition) can assist with mitigation of the ML/TF risks associated with the use of Virtual Assets.  Technological features, such as secure digital signatures that allow the verification of a Client’s identity through a signed document, may also be acceptable to the FSRA. In all cases, an Authorised Person should ensure that the use of these technologies will not lead to a simplified process where the required Customer Risk Assessment and CDD requirements are not appropriately undertaken by an Authorised Person.\n\nm)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nThe FSRA recommends that Authorised Persons obtain a signed self-certification from their Clients identifying the details of all passports issued and held in their name(s). Authorised Persons may also use this as an opportunity to capture all tax related details in order to meet their international tax reporting obligations. Self-certification should not prevent Authorised Persons from conducting proper CDD.\n\n\nn)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nAuthorised Persons are required to implement an appropriate governance structure, especially in relation to Information Technology governance , and provide for the development and maintenance of all necessary systems and controls to ensure appropriate ML and TF compliance.\n\no)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nThe FSRA expects that Authorised Persons may seek to utilise (their own or third-party) technologies and solutions to meet their regulatory obligations (e.g., customer risk assessment, detection of fraud, and transaction identification, monitoring and reporting) and risk management requirements (e.g., margin limits, large exposure monitoring).\n\np)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons to develop, implement and maintain effective transactional monitoring systems to determine the origin of a Virtual Asset and to monitor its destination, and to apply strong “know your transaction” measures which enable Authorised Persons to have complete granular data centric information about the transactions done by a Client.\n\nq)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons to act responsibly and always be vigilant in ensuring that their activities are not subject to any misuse by participants transacting with Virtual Assets that may have been tainted in any way from an illegal activity.  The FSRA expects that an Authorised Person’s internal processes establish the types of ‘indicators’ or activities that could be used to identify when Accepted Virtual Assets may have been used in an illegal manner.  An Authorised Person should have a process for the management of when such ‘indicators’ (for example, certain Client or use of “mixer” and “tumbler” services) are triggered.\n\nr)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nWhile the FSRA cannot recommend particular vendors or providers, all technology solutions must be fit for purpose and Authorised Persons should consider using those with an established track record, and undertake their own due diligence/risk assessment to ensure competency and capability.  The FSRA recognises that many of the (technology) solutions appropriate for mitigating Virtual Asset risks are continuing to be developed within the Virtual Asset industry itself.\n\ns)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons to develop, implement and adhere to a “Virtual Asset Compliance Policy”, tailored to meet specific Virtual Asset business compliance requirements, and reflecting a clear comprehension of the Authorised Person’s understanding of its compliance responsibilities.  The FSRA expects this policy to be well defined, comprehensive, robust and as specific to an individual Authorised Person’s activities as possible. The policy can be separate or part of other compliance policies/manuals.\n\nt)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nFollowing the development of the Virtual Asset Compliance Policy, Authorised Persons’ compliance officers are expected to establish a “Virtual Asset compliance monitoring program”, requiring internal reviews to be conducted in an efficient way, and on a periodic basis.\n\nu)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nAuthorised Persons must appoint a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (“MLRO”) who will be responsible for the implementation and oversight of the Authorised Person’s compliance with the AML Rules.  Consistent with the FSRA’s expectation in relation to all other Authorised Persons, an MLRO should have an appropriate level of seniority and independence in order to be effective in the role.\n\nv)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 5: Suspicious Activity Reporting obligations\nAuthorised Persons should familiarise themselves with their reporting obligations under the AML Rules, in particular in relation to the reporting of suspicious activities/transactions.\n\nw)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 5: Suspicious Activity Reporting obligations\nPrior to commencing operations, the FSRA expects Authorised Persons to establish online connectivity with the UAE’s Financial Intelligence Unit for the purposes of submitting Suspicious Activity Reports (“SARs”). Instructions on how to do this can be found on the FSRA’s FCPU webpage.\n\nx)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 5: Suspicious Activity Reporting obligations\nAuthorised Persons are required to establish sophisticated transaction monitoring systems to detect possible ML and TF activities. Systems should also be implemented to effectively identify any attempt to breach domestic and international sanctions. Such systems may rely on new technological solutions (including monitoring algorithms or Artificial Intelligence (“AI”)).\n\ny)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\nAs proper documentation is one of the main pillars of ensuring AML/CFT compliance, Authorised Persons are required to have policies and procedures in place to ensure proper record keeping practices. It is expected that an Authorised Person will maintain up to date records in accordance with the CDD obligations applicable to it and be prepared to provide the records upon request from the FSRA.\n\nz)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\nThe FSRA understands that the transaction recording of many Virtual Asset transactions is linked to, or based on, DLT. This requires an Authorised Person to implement specific arrangements to ensure that, at a minimum, the Authorised Person and the FSRA have access to all relevant information as necessary. An Authorised Person may use a distributed ledger to store its data, provided it is able to provide this data, in an easily accessible format, to the FSRA when required.\n\naa)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\nThe FSRA views Virtual Asset activities that are linked to cash transactions as posing higher ML and TF risks, due to the source of funding being significantly more difficult to determine. Authorised Persons wishing to conduct cash transactions will be required to implement enhanced controls to mitigate the inherent risks of such transactions. Such controls may include, among other things, setting appropriate limits on cash deposits (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly limits), a prohibition on receiving cash directly, prohibitions on the receipt of cash other than from bank accounts, and prohibitions on receiving funds from third parties. In all cases, Authorised Persons will need to clearly demonstrate to the FSRA how their controls suitably mitigate the risks of cash transactions within their operations. Considering the wider consumer protection implications, the FSRA also considers it unlikely to be appropriate for Authorised Persons to accept deposits by way of credit card or credit facilities/credit lines.\n\nbb)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\nFSRA expects all Authorised Persons to exercise due care, to the utmost extent possible, in their day-to-day operations and when dealing with Clients or potential Clients.  An Authorised Person’s activities are expected to be in compliance with the AML Rules, ensuring that their activities do not pose a regulatory risk or reputational damage to the ADGM Financial System.\n"

    "answer": "The regulator monitors ongoing compliance with Market Risk model requirements primarily through the following mechanisms:\n\n### **1. Monitoring Through Reporting Obligations**\nAuthorised Persons are required to implement a system of internal reporting to ensure compliance with Market Risk policies and approved models. Specifically, the reporting system must generate **relevant, accurate, comprehensive, timely, and reliable reports** on Market Risk. These reports are used to monitor and assess adherence to approved models and must:\n\n- **Alert senior management** to the size of Market Risk exposures and their relationship to established limits.\n- Highlight **exceptions** to the Market Risk policy.\n- Present the **results of stress tests** undertaken by the firm.\n- Provide an **analysis and explanation of any changes** to the level and nature of Market Risk, as well as any remedial actions proposed or implemented.  \n(Reference: **Reference 2**)\n\nThese reports ensure transparency and keep the regulator informed indirectly through the Authorised Person's internal controls.\n\n### **2. Ongoing Risk Management Framework and Updates**\nAuthorised Persons are required to maintain and implement a **comprehensive Market Risk management framework**. This framework must be designed to manage, measure, and monitor Market Risk effectively and be commensurate with the **nature, scale, and complexity** of the Authorised Person's operations. \n\nMoreover, the Authorised Person is obligated to **review and update their Market Risk policy** periodically to ensure that it remains appropriate and effective. This is especially important when there are changes in the firm’s activities or external conditions.  \n(Reference: **Reference 1(a), 1(c)** and **Reference 4**)\n\n### **3. Compliance with Capital Requirements**\nThe framework must also include mechanisms to calculate the **Market Risk Capital Requirement** and ensure that the Authorised Person holds sufficient capital to meet this requirement. Adherence to capital requirements serves as a direct measure of compliance with approved Market Risk models.  \n(Reference: **Reference 4(b)**)\n\n### **4. Regulator's Role in Supervision**\nThe regulator retains the power to assess whether an Authorised Person continues to meet the following criteria:\n- The Authorised Person is capable of being effectively supervised.\n- Its compliance arrangements (including policies, procedures, and systems) remain adequate to meet regulatory requirements.  \n(Reference: **Reference 5(3), 5(4)**)\n\nThis supervision involves reviewing both internal reports and external submissions, as well as conducting periodic inspections.\n\n### **5. Stress Testing and Model Validation**\nTo demonstrate ongoing adherence to the approved Market Risk models, Authorised Persons must perform regular **stress tests** and include the results in their internal management reports. These tests are crucial for assessing the robustness of the Market Risk model under extreme market conditions and provide the regulator with assurances of compliance through internal oversight.  \n(Reference: **Reference 2(c)**)\n\n### **6. Demonstrating Compliance through Periodic Reviews**\nThe Authorised Person is expected to undertake periodic reviews of its processes, policies, and systems to identify, assess, and mitigate risks effectively. These reviews must be informed by a **risk-based approach**, ensuring that the Authorised Person allocates sufficient resources to manage higher-risk areas of its Market Risk framework.  \n(Reference: **Reference 1(b)**)\n\n### **Key Takeaways on Reporting**\nTo summarize, Authorised Persons must provide:\n1. **Internal management reports** detailing Market Risk exposures, exceptions to policy, stress test results, and analysis of risk changes.\n2. Evidence of adherence to a robust **Market Risk management framework** through periodic reviews, policy updates, and compliance with capital requirements.\n3. Documentation of how any identified issues or exceptions are addressed to maintain compliance with regulatory expectations.\n\nBy fulfilling these obligations, Authorised Persons demonstrate their ongoing adherence to approved Market Risk models, allowing the regulator to monitor compliance effectively."
