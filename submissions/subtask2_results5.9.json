Authorised Persons should establish and maintain procedures for judging the necessity of and calculating an adjustment to the current valuation of less liquid positions for regulatory capital purposes. This adjustment may be in addition to any changes to the value of the position required for financial reporting purposes and should be designed to reflect the illiquidity of the position. The Regulator expects Authorised Persons to consider the need for an adjustment to a position's valuation to reflect current illiquidity whether the position is marked to market using market prices or observable inputs, third party valuations or marked to model."

Reduced liquidity may have arisen from market events. Additionally, close out prices for concentrated positions and/or stale positions should be considered in establishing the adjustment."

    "answer": "1. **Direct Answer to the Core Question:**\n\n   The expectations for documenting the rationale and methodology behind valuation adjustments for less liquid positions involve establishing procedures to determine the necessity and calculation of such adjustments. These procedures must reflect the illiquidity of positions, considering various factors to ensure the adjustment is appropriate.\n\n2. **Citations of Supporting Legal Provisions:**\n\n   - Authorized Persons should establish and maintain procedures for judging the necessity of and calculating an adjustment to the current valuation of less liquid positions, considering factors such as market prices, third-party valuations, or model-based valuations (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: APP2.A2.5.Guidance.10).\n   \n   - Relevant factors in determining the appropriateness of valuation adjustments include the time required to hedge positions, volatility of bid/offer spreads, availability of market quotes, trading volumes, market concentrations, aging of positions, reliance on model-based valuations, and other model risks (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: APP2.A2.5.Guidance.12).\n   \n   - For complex products, assessment of valuation adjustments should explicitly address model risks, including incorrect valuation methodologies and unobservable calibration parameters (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: APP2.A2.5.Guidance.13).\n   \n   - Assumptions made in calculating Value at Risk (VaR) may not align with the ability to sell or hedge less liquid positions, warranting an ongoing review of the appropriateness of valuation adjustments (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: APP2.A2.5.Guidance.11).\n   \n3. **Additional Explanations:**\n\n   The rationale and methodology behind valuation adjustments should be well-documented, as they impact regulatory capital requirements and may differ from financial reporting standards. The adjustments are intended to account for the reduced liquidity and potential market events affecting positions. Regular review and consideration of market conditions, product complexity, and model risks are crucial to maintain accurate and reliable valuation adjustments.\n\n4. **Special Notes or Cautions:**\n\n   It is important to note that discrepancies between an Authorised Person's valuation procedures and the regulatory guidance may lead to imposed valuation adjustments by the Regulator (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: 2.4.Guidance.4).\n\nIn summary, the documentation of valuation adjustments for less liquid positions involves a comprehensive approach that includes establishing procedures, considering a wide range of market and product-specific factors, and ensuring ongoing review and consistency with regulatory guidelines."
